# FOOSIE
Free Object-Oriented SDL Isometric Engine (FOOSIE) is a Free and Open-Source (FOSS) isometric game engine in C++ using SDL's built-in renderer licensed under the GNU LGPL v3.0 or later. 

## Composition
FOOSIE is composed of three main components: The Isometric Renderer, The Object Class System, and The World. These three work together along with the core engine library to create a fully-functional game world.
